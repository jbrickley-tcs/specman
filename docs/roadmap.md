# SpecMan Roadmap

## MCP Server (v1.1.0)
- **Target window:** Next few days
- **Goal:** Deliver an MCP server layer that can execute SpecMan workflows without shell access, enabling AI agents to apply workspace changes safely through MCP protocols.
- **Outcome:** Marks the v1.1.0 release once the server is stable and supports full command coverage for existing automation tasks.

## Relationship Graphing (GraphRAG)
- **Target window:** Q2–Q3
- **Goal:** Extend the current document parser to read inline Markdown links and headers, build a relationship graph, and feed it into GraphRAG-powered analysis.
- **Outcome:** Smarter dependency insights and contextual responses driven by the inferred relationship graph.
